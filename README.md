Made with pure HTML, CSS, and JS. Built off of FE Mentor's design.

- Dedicated messages if no user is found or if user has no bio
- If profile has no name, shows username instead
- Other blank profile information shows as 'N/A'
- Active links to a user's (valid) website, Twitter, or company Github profile
- Octocat is the default profile on initial load
