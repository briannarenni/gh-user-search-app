Made with pure HTML, CSS, and JS. Built off of FE Mentor's design.

## MVP Behavior

- Shows Octocat profile on first load
- Displays "No Results" if no user is found, and "This profile has no bio" message if bio is empty
- Active links to a user's website, Twitter, or company Github profile
- If profile has no name, shows username instead
- Shows "N/A" for any other blank profile information
